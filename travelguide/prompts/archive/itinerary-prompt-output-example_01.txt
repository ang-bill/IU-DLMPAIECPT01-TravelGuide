      "route_description": "From Wilhelmsburg, navigate towards the Danube crossing at Krems. Follow signs towards Gföhl. Your first main destination is the Senftenberg Castle Ruin. Afterwards, consider a scenic drive north-east towards Gars am Kamp or Altenburg for the atmosphere, then looping back westwards towards the Gföhl/Jaidenföhnen area to find a quiet overnight spot, perhaps near some woods or a designated Stellplatz if preferred.",

      "route_description": "From your overnight location near Gföhl, head northwest towards Arbesbach to visit its prominent ruin. Afterwards, consider the short detour to Höllfall if conditions seem suitable for a brief nature walk. The main afternoon goal is the Blockheide near Gmünd. Drive through scenic backroads, perhaps via Groß Gerungs or Rappottenstein (viewing from afar if already visited). Find an overnight spot near Gmünd or Heidenreichstein.",

Consider routing via the historical town of Weitra for a brief walk around. Continue southwards on scenic roads, perhaps crossing the Danube at Pöchlarn or Melk, before completing the final leg back to Wilhelmsburg.",
