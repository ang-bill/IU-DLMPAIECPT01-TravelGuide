Take into account: The items in overview-section of the JSON are fixed, whereas the items (and JSON keys) in the need_to_know-section of the JSON should be selected upon the given context and preferences. The description should be half a page. did_you_know and riddles should be 5 items each. The language of the text should be as mentioned earlier.

Do a final check if the JSON is valid as it is processed with Python json.loads(): Check if all keys and string values are enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes may be used inside string values if needed. Only return the JSON without any additional text.
