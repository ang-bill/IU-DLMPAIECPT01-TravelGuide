{ 'description': 'Well now, if you find yourself wandering about the Waldviertel, feeling all historical and '
                 'picturesque (as one does!), I reckon you simply *must* cast your gaze upon the Burgruine Lichtenegg. '
                 'Imagine, if you will, a sturdy old castle, its glory days faded like a sepia-toned photograph, yet '
                 "still standing proud against the relentless march of time. This isn't your fancy, spiffed-up palace; "
                 "this is a *ruin*, mind you, a proper ruin! Which means it's got character, secrets whispered on the "
                 'wind, and just the right amount of crumbling stonework to ignite the imagination. \n'
                 '\n'
                 "Perched upon a craggy outcrop like an eagle's nest, Lichtenegg surveys the land with a quiet "
                 'dignity. You can practically feel the ghosts of knights and noble ladies milling about, their '
                 'whispers carried on the breeze. Bring your off-road chariot, because getting there might involve a '
                 "bit of a bumpy ride – but that's half the fun, isn't it? Once you've wrestled your vehicle into "
                 "submission near the base of the ruin, prepare for a bit of a climb. The path isn't exactly paved "
                 'with gold, but the views from the top? Oh, those are worth their weight in diamonds! The rolling '
                 'hills of the Waldviertel stretch out before you, a tapestry of fields and forests, dotted with '
                 'charming villages. \n'
                 '\n'
                 'Pack a picnic basket, find yourself a sun-drenched spot amongst the ancient stones, and let the wee '
                 'one (and the big furry one!) scamper about. Just keep a watchful eye, of course – ruins and toddlers '
                 "aren't always the best of friends. Lichtenegg ain't just a pretty face; it's got a history to it, "
                 'too. Sadly, History seems to have lost most documents about Lichtenegg. But that allows to dream and '
                 'speculate, I presume? This ruin is a blank page that History asks to fill!\n'

                 "So, if you're looking for a taste of the past, a healthy dose of fresh air, and a spot of adventure, "
                 "steer your trusty vehicle towards Burgruine Lichtenegg. It's a place where history comes alive, "
                 "where the imagination takes flight, and where even the most seasoned traveler can't help but feel a "
                 "sense of awe. And who knows, maybe you'll even stumble upon a hidden treasure or two... or at least "
                 "a particularly well-preserved stone. Now, isn't that worth the trip?",
